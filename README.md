# 106A-DART

Our project aims to develop a transformable robotic vehicle that can transform from a car to a drone. It will achieve this by rotating the wheels 90 degrees and take flight using built-in propellers. It will be equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in its path, and navigate around them, either by maneuvering on the ground or flying over it. This innovative design offers the potential for enhanced mobility and versatility in various applications, such as search and rescue operations, exploration, and package delivery.
